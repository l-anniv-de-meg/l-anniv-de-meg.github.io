<h1> Happy Birthday ya big dumb fool</h1>

<h3> So, this is your personalised Birthday gift. No it's not a game. But YES, i hope it is hella cute.</h3>
<h3> Geez you know I thought, better give you something worth money, then I thought, something personal, and then I thought, why not both.</h3>


<h4> Just before you go and explore this website from the navigation bar at the top. I would like to say this has genuinely been such a fun gift to make its been the best I have ever felt making a gift for someone, and who better than the for the most important person in my life.</h4> 
<h4> It has taken me give or take a whole month and literally everything you see in this website has been made from scratch. No wix,nothing has been used. Every detail about this website comes from a code, including the colour and navigation bar and anything.</h4>
<h4> Literally everything has been made on a notepad, this is the magic of HTML. Nothing was chosen from a menu or any help, EVERYTHING you see is literally originating from few (in some cases hundreds) of lines of code.</h4>
<h4> To give you perspective, this is literally what the page looks like until i press a save button with .html, and then it looks like what you are seeing</h4>

<h4> So anyways, it took a lot lot of effort. But I am really proud of it because you deserve that effort, and even more. This is the first personal gift I spent time and effort on so it feels nice. I hope you like it and don't dismiss it as an easy task. Some of these pages took days to code.</h4>
<h3> Finishing off, You are amazing and just a joy. Have a stunning 19th. T'aime wesh meufe ❤️<h3>

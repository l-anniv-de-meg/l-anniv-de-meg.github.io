Megumi is a ray of sunshine that will change your life for the better.
She's kind, passionate and dedicated, and is always ready for an adventure. 
10/10 recommend hanging out with this 10.

<blockquote>
Megumi is by far one of the BEST people that anyone can meet and be friends with.
She can improve anyone's mood by simply being there, she is incredibly supportive, funny and talented making the world a better place. 
10/10 would recommend become friends with her.

"Megumi" never gets old. 
I have experienced her growing up from age 10 on and there has never been a time where she failed to provide me with the spiciest forms of entertainment and shooting her shot for any food nearby.
Newer developments in her coming of age plotline include her fantastic asian glow, not only observed through her personality but especially after the repeated consumption of cherry flavored rosé from the U next to cdm. 
Overall, she is one of the most loyal people I am blessed to have in my life.
Whether the theme is cheese themed songs or tmi sexual jokes she is never short of a personality (though maybe in height).
I would definitely recommend to a friend.10/10 Because of how fun and outgoing she is and also because she never has had a problem associating with me despite my many embarrassing moments.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5 

Hmm my Gumi bear, imma give you a 4.5 friendship star rating. Hm why did you lose the .5? Maybe because each time anyone ever try’s to speak there’s this second voice buzzing and slowly bit by bit that voice gets louder.. hehe but I love ya! 
So the 4.5 is because you’ve always been there for me when I needed you, whether that be us speed walking across the bridge cause we were hella late, fun picnics!! Which we need to have more of! Or just random adventures and good times! 
I’m so happy you spoke to me that first day of English class (even if the only reason was my name 😡) but regardless so happy you did- I miss you so much and I hope to come see you- or you to me!! Cause I always come to you!! (You lazy fuck) but regardless I hope you have the greatest birthday ever today! And we can do zoom drinks! Maybe! If the timing is right eheh- but , happy birthday too you, happy birthday too you, happy birthday dear my Gumi bear, happy birthday too youuu!! Hip hip horray. Hip hip horray. Hip hip horray. 
Whooo- also I think I might push you down to a ⭐️⭐️⭐️ star rating cause you keep cough cheating cough at pool and beating me 😡😡 but happy birthday Gumi bear! Love you so much ❤️🥳🕺🏼🕺🏼🧡🐻🐧💞🥂🍹🦠🎈🎈🧸🎊🎊🎉🎁🎁🎈🎈

<p>And now <i>Maira Luchini Costa</i> has a few kind words to say about our feature today</p>
<blockquote>
Dear Megumi,
I would first like to thank you for being such an amazing friend throughout all these years. I’m sorry I didn’t really talk to you when we first met... some people are just not as outgoing as you 😝
I’m so incredibly grateful that you are in my life. I love that I can be who I truly am around you, and that we can understand and be there for each other no matter what. I feel like we are so similar yet so different, and that’s the beauty of this friendship. We are continously learning to respect each other’s opinions while still being truthful to ourselves.
I wish you good luck with your studies and everything else you’re doing. I know that you are a very persistent person and you should definitely keep using this to your advantage. Never give up!
Thank you for everything ❤️
Happy birthday 🐼🎉
Here’s to many more crazy adventures
Love you,
Maira

Being Megumi's friend is like: Awesome! She's the one who drains my battery. 
(Good to have someone who takes me out to use some energy + exercise) 👍 And fun too with her jokes sometimes.
Looking forward to see more creative jokes.

Being Megumi's friend, or in my case, her best friend, is one of the best choices I ever made.
Actually, even without choosing it, we were just magnetized to eachother, and even though we are physically far, we will keep coming back.
Me and Megumi Bagumi are friends for around 6 years now, they say that friends of 7 years will stay friends forever (one more year to go megu!).
So what's it like being her friend? Wow, its amazing, she is so many things at the same time.
She is absolutely hilarious (and dirty minded!!), when she's around I feel safe and I always laugh so much! 
We have our jokes and we understand eachother so well. Our friendship isn't somerhing we need to put effort into, we love eachother and know we will always be there for one another.
Megumi is caring and makes you feel good around her, even though clumsy sometimes, she will try her best to help me and she knows she can rely on me to help her anytime.

We have shared an enormous amount of secrets throughout the years and have learnt to trust eachother.
Megumi can be loyal (when she wants to), and sensitive. She likes to share things and get my opinion on them, which always makes me happy and I feel like she wants to know what I think.
Megumi is a hardworking friend. She will always wanna hangout and will spend a lot of time with you and will never get bored or boring!
Megumi is the type of friend who would let you copy off her test without caring (although in out case, it was normally the opposite....), the type of friend who would get mad at your boyfriend for hurting you, she is the type of friend who would chat with you on email chat instead of doing her Japanese essay due 4 hours later!
She is a true friend, and I cherish this friendship so much. We know eachother so well and while we hype eachother (and we could totally do crazy things together) we also balance eachother.

We are spontaneous and could have fun in the smallest things - sitting together in science class, sleepovers, runs (ummm this happened like a few times haha), rock climbing, passy! 
We have gained so many memories together and I cant express how much I really really love Megumi!
